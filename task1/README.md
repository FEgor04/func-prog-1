# Project Euler. Task 1 in OCaml

### Problem
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Implementations
- Recursion at [rec.ml](./lib/rec.ml)
- Tail recursion at [tailrec.ml](./lib/tailrec.ml)
- Module impmenetation wtih separate generation, `filter`, and `fold` at [modulish.ml](./lib/modulish.ml)
- `map` implementation at [map.ml](./lib/map.ml)
- Imperative implementation with loops at [imperative.ml](./lib/imperative.ml)
