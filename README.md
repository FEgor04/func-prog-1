## Project Euler 1

### Problem
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Implementation

See [task1/README.md](./task1/README.md)

## Project Euler 30

### Problem

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
```
1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
```

As `1 = 1^4` is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is `1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316`.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits. 

### Implementation
